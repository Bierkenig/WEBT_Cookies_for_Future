# WEBT_Cookies_for_Future
 
Cookies for Future - a local chinese restaurant wants to help reducing produced waste by switching to digital fortune cookies. You are to develop a webapp in which users receive a random fortune cookie text by clicking on a button. Optional: make the service IP resistant, so greedy fortune hunters are unable to pull an arbitrary number of fortune texts.
